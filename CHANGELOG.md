## 0.25.0 - 2026-09-30

**Highlights:** Grok and Devin CLI summaries with isolated configuration, new OpenAI model support, and dependency security fixes.

- Security: update brace-expansion in extension tooling to bound comma, nesting, and closing-brace parsing, preventing stack exhaustion and CPU denial of service.
- CLI providers: add opt-in Grok CLI summaries with private prompt files, auth-only home isolation, disabled tools/web/MCP/subagents, strict sandboxing, usage/cost reporting, and daemon/Chrome model picker support (#498, thanks @vincent-peng).
- CLI providers: add opt-in Devin CLI summaries with private prompt files, ATIF token accounting, isolated configuration, and workspace trust checks for caller directories (#499, thanks @vincent-peng).
- OpenAI: support GPT-6.1 Sol (`openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) with pricing and model-picker entries, omit its unsupported `temperature` parameter, and reject its unsupported `--thinking none` before sending a request (#500, thanks @zackleman).

## 0.24.0 - 2026-09-25

**Highlights:** GPT-6 support with pricing, compatibility guidance for the retired GitHub Models provider, and Node 26 and command-reference fixes.

- OpenAI: support GPT-6 (Astra, Sol, Luna) models, omit the unsupported `temperature` parameter on reasoning requests, and keep `--thinking none` for Sol/Luna (#495, thanks @roboclaw-bot).
- OpenAI: include GPT-6 in the model picker with published pricing and context limits, estimate costs without a downloaded pricing cache, and reject Astra's unsupported `--thinking none` before sending a request.
- Compatibility: remove the retired GitHub Models API provider and its advertised integrations; saved `github-copilot/...` and browser GitHub provider settings fail with a clear retirement message instead of silently switching providers. The separate `cli/copilot` integration remains available (#494, thanks @vincent-peng).

- Node.js: keep native extension catalog imports working on Node 26 while retaining the Node 24 minimum (#492, thanks @vincent-peng).
- CLI docs and completions: match real daemon routes, flag scopes, exit codes, reasoning aliases, timeout semantics, and output-language suggestions (#493, thanks @vincent-peng).

## 0.23.1 - 2026-09-24

**Highlights:** reliable slide flags, complete fish suggestions, browser media cancellation fixes, and safer npm publication logs.

- CLI slides: preserve URLs and media inputs following bare `--slides`, reject malformed per-run slide options, and return HTTP 400 for invalid daemon requests while preserving stored-config tolerance (#488, thanks @vincent-peng).
- CLI completions: offer every shipped interface locale across commands, keep locale values separate from daemon subcommands, and restore missing existing flag suggestions and documentation (#486, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Browser media: pick up upstream stream-disposal cancellation and transcription runtime fixes, alongside stabilized file detection and test tooling (#487, thanks @dependabot).
- Release: keep npm verification codes out of command logs while preserving the documented `NPM_OTP` setting and pnpm's required authentication argument (#489).

## 0.23.0 - 2026-09-21

**Highlights:** complete multilingual interfaces, safer guarded networking, and resilient cache and daemon logging.

- Localization: add complete German, French, Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, Polish, Russian, Japanese, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, and Korean interfaces alongside English and Turkish, with typed ICU catalogs, system/browser locale negotiation, and CI enforcement for missing, stale, mismatched, and uncatalogued messages; thanks @husodrn46 for the original Turkish support.
- Network: handle bodyless and invalid responses in the DNS-pinned transport without crashing, and honor cancellation carried by Request objects.
- Network: strip authorization and cookie headers on cross-origin guarded redirects, retain same-origin Request options, and cancel discarded redirect bodies.
- Media cache: remove superseded files when a URL's cached filename extension changes so obsolete downloads do not escape the size cap.
- Daemon logging: contain directory-creation failures within the write queue and retry initialization on later writes instead of crashing or permanently dropping logs.
- Daemon logging: recreate a log directory removed while the daemon is running so later writes recover automatically.
- Maintenance: refresh stabilized runtime, browser media, and development dependencies; replace local security backports with upstream fixes while retaining the asynchronous ZIP-extraction stop fix (#482, thanks @dependabot).
- Pricing: retain fetched model pricing when the home directory or disk cache is unavailable.
- Release docs: use the Chrome archive helper so the manifest stays at the ZIP root, and clarify that CI publishes the verified release assets.

## 0.22.0 - 2026-09-14

**Highlights:** Twitter/X Syndication fallback and Turkish interfaces, plus Antigravity print-mode steering and large-prompt offloading.

- Twitter/X: add the unauthenticated Syndication API between CLI clients and Nitter, preserving explicit transcript requests and complete-text fallbacks (#401, thanks @mvance).
- Localization: add Turkish CLI and extension interfaces while preserving English for existing profiles, independent summary language, and original user content and diagnostics (#398, thanks @husodrn46).
- Antigravity: offload oversized prompts to a private temporary document, preserve task instructions, and clean up after success, failure, or timeout (#400, thanks @mvance).
- Antigravity: steer print-mode text summaries away from tool narration and local file links, accounting for guidance in argv limits (#390, thanks @mvance).
- Automation: let the element picker’s Cancel button dismiss selection instead of intercepting its click (#398, thanks @husodrn46).
- Docs: document the macOS 13 minimum for standalone release archives.

## 0.21.15 - 2026-09-14

- Security: backport the adm-zip destination-symlink extraction fix (GHSA-vwc7-r8mq-g2x9) while its new release completes the seven-day stabilization hold.
- Slide text: avoid splitting Unicode surrogate pairs when shortening transcript or OCR text.
- ONNX transcription: keep staged audio available until inference exits and discard interrupted model downloads so retries cannot reuse partial artifacts.
- CLI: preserve unrelated host logging globals, including read-only AI SDK settings.
- Refresh Free: honor `FORCE_COLOR=0` and use the same color-override precedence as the rest of the CLI.
- Browser automation: detect immediate User Scripts execution support and give older Chrome versions an accurate upgrade requirement.

- Docs: correct the slides command JSON envelope, image paths, and OCR manifest examples.

## 0.21.14 - 2026-09-11

**Highlights:** correct podcast episode selection for non-Latin titles and stabilized network/media reliability updates.

- Podcasts: preserve Unicode episode titles and meaningful combining marks so RSS transcripts and audio match the requested episode; reject empty matching keys (#445, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Network: update Undici to 8.10.2 for upstream HTTP, retry, cache, TLS, and WebSocket security fixes.
- Browser media: stop failed MediaBunny sample iterators from continuing internally with MediaBunny 1.55.7.
- Models: refresh Pi AI to 0.85.0 for provider-stream and proxy fixes while retaining Node 24 support.
- Maintenance: refresh stabilized DOM, Oxc, Chrome typings, and Vitest tooling; patch the YAML tooling dependency and update the pinned Pages action after its seven-day hold (#402, #446, thanks @dependabot).

## 0.21.13 - 2026-09-07

**Highlights:** browser media reliability fixes and stabilized dependency updates.

### Documentation

- Correct Firefox signing guidance to match the extension ID in published packages.

## 0.21.12 - 2026-09-06

**Highlight:** a reliability and architecture cleanup release, including live-tested fixes for OpenAI image inputs, podcast feed routing, and missing slide frames.

### Fixes

- Slides: measure frame timestamps after the requested seek point, preventing later scenes from being assigned earlier timestamps and discarded as duplicates; regenerate older extraction caches with the corrected timing.
- Podcasts: route RSS and Atom feed URLs through content/transcript extraction instead of treating feed XML as a raw file, while preserving ordinary XML asset handling.
- Images: preserve image attachments in OpenAI Responses and Chat Completions requests, including streaming, instead of silently sending only the text prompt.
- Slides: stop direct-video response streams after download failures and remove downloaded temporary files if the media-cache handoff fails; preserve the original failure when cleanup also fails.
- Browser AI: give overlapping Prompt API requests separate sessions and destroy sessions that finish loading after cancellation, so a stale request cannot tear down its replacement.
- Slides: parse ordinary yt-dlp percentage lines correctly and remove partial download directories after process or output-inspection failures.
- Transcription: skip probing the local Whisper executable when no usable model is installed, avoiding unnecessary process startup and delays on cloud-only or unconfigured systems.
- Browser settings: retain a dismissed local-companion hint when saving other Options preferences.
- Browser chat: normalize partial or malformed saved usage metadata and unknown stop reasons when restoring assistant history.
- Slides: drain ignored subprocess output so a verbose media tool cannot stall on a full stdout pipe.
- Transcript cache: preserve embedded-caption and native YouTube media source metadata across cache hits instead of losing it to duplicated source lists.
- Browser media: support MP4 files carrying Annex B AVC/HEVC and clarify missing WebCodecs errors in insecure contexts with MediaBunny 1.55.3.
- FAL transcription: clear settled deadlines and stop local queue polling and retries after timeout (#392, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Content extraction: decode HTML entities once so deliberately escaped markup remains literal text (#394, thanks @devYRPauli).
- Content extraction: avoid splitting UTF-16 surrogate pairs when clipping to a character budget (#391, thanks @devYRPauli).

### Security

- Pin patched nanoid transitives to fix GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8 while preserving the tested local image-size security fixes.

### Dependencies and maintenance

- Consolidate model execution, provider metadata, request construction, retries, streaming, and token usage while preserving protocol-specific behavior and output-failure boundaries.
- Share asset conversion, podcast resolution, transcription, media download, slide extraction, and cache metadata ownership; remove duplicated pipelines and unused adapters.
- Simplify side-panel state, Options wiring, model discovery, pickers, component mounting, and shared styles without changing layouts or supported settings.
- Type-check the entire extension in the root gate and CI; centralize test streams and browser lifecycles while preserving isolated profiles and runtime-error checks.
- Repair browser-local speech validation with public audio and real decoding/inference; make Firefox smoke wait for installation and clean up its own runner and profile.
- Remove the abandoned Homebrew-tap writer, keep formula updates with Homebrew/core, and correct pnpm release commands.
- Refresh stabilized DOM, Markdown, browser media, image, protobuf, and pnpm dependencies; repair the Node 24 test container and preserve local security patches (#403, thanks @dependabot).
- Refresh Pi AI and Oxc while keeping Node typings aligned with the supported Node 24 runtime (#399, thanks @dependabot).
- Refresh the remaining runtime/test tooling and Bun builder, pin CI actions, and align Dependabot with pnpm's seven-day stabilization policy.

## 0.21.11 - 2026-08-10

**Highlight:** a security pass — five high-severity advisories cleared from the
dependency graph, and the two that have no upstream fix (`image-size` parser
loops) are now neutralized by a local patch with regression coverage.

### Security

- Clear five high-severity advisories: `fast-uri` host confusion (dev-only here; the SSRF guard uses native WHATWG URL parsing and now carries backslash-authority regression coverage), `js-yaml` quadratic CPU in `!!omap` resolution (CVE-2026-59870), `brace-expansion` unbounded-expansion DoS (both major lines), and `nanoid` zero-size generator loop.
- Neutralize the two unpatched `image-size` ICNS/JXL/HEIF infinite-loop advisories (dev-only under `web-ext`/`addons-linter`) with a checked-in pnpm patch and a timeout-isolated regression test. The audit deliberately still reports the version match — the advisory is fixed locally, not silenced.

### Dependencies and maintenance

- Migrate the build to TypeScript 7 across all workspaces, porting the import-cycle gate to an Oxc-based checker proven against static imports, re-exports, dynamic imports, import types, and a deliberately introduced cycle.
- Refresh mediabunny, markdansi, undici, and the oxc toolchain, plus the transitive Babel/acorn/postcss graph.

## 0.21.10 - 2026-08-09

### Fixes

- Google custom endpoints: skip Gemini Developer API model discovery before inference, so endpoint-scoped credentials reach the endpoint you configured. Previously any Google key triggered discovery against the hard-coded Developer API first, and a Vertex-scoped or proxied key failed there before your `GOOGLE_BASE_URL` was ever contacted. Discovery still runs when the endpoint is unset or explicitly the Developer API. Note that a custom endpoint now validates its own model IDs (#384, thanks @alfozan).

## 0.21.9 - 2026-08-08

### Fixes

- Chrome extension: restore Video + Slides capture from toolbar-opened side panels by granting production builds the visible-tab access Chrome requires.
- Summaries: structure multi-point pages and discussion threads as scannable Markdown blocks instead of dense prose.
- Security: route remote asset classification and downloads through the daemon's SSRF-guarded fetcher (#380, thanks @bunlongheng).
- Chrome extension: stop cancelled or disconnected native-companion bridge requests before they can launch a stale native host (#379, thanks @vincent-peng).

### Dependencies and maintenance

- Refresh policy-eligible runtime, extension, browser media, test, formatting, lint, and type dependencies.

### Documentation

- Rewrite the README as a concise front door to the CLI, browser extension, and task-focused guides.

### Dependencies and maintenance

- Refresh policy-eligible runtime, browser media, test, formatting, and lint dependencies.

## 0.21.7 - 2026-07-27

### Highlights

- Chrome extension: restore persisted Logs and Processes tabs without aborting options-page startup (#370, #371; thanks @ostehost).
- Refresh policy-eligible dependencies and remove the vulnerable cleanup chain, including patched protobufjs and sharp transitive releases.

### Dependencies and maintenance

- Refresh the CLI, browser-media, test, formatting, lint, and GitHub Actions toolchain.
- Sign and notarize the Bun macOS executables, verify both architectures without signing credentials, and publish only the verified artifacts.
- Embed the tokenizer vocabulary in standalone Bun executables so release binaries do not depend on checkout files.

## 0.21.6 - 2026-07-18

### Highlights

- Xiaoyuzhou podcast pages now resolve their validated episode audio automatically for extraction and summaries.

### Features

- Podcasts: resolve Xiaoyuzhou episode pages through validated audio metadata (#364, thanks @Owengogogo).

### Dependencies and maintenance

- Refresh policy-eligible runtime, test, type, formatting, and lint dependencies.
- Pin patched `adm-zip` metadata handling for the extension's ONNX runtime toolchain.

## 0.21.5 - 2026-07-16

### Fixes

- whisper.cpp: disable cross-window text context to prevent cascading repetition and truncated long-form transcripts (#363, thanks @Owengogogo).

## 0.21.4 - 2026-07-16

### Fixes

- URL routing: classify YouTube inputs by hostname so lookalike domains use normal website extraction and labels.
- CLI arguments: preserve `--` so dash-prefixed local paths remain valid positional inputs.
- CLI providers: synchronize Copilot, Antigravity, and pi setup, overrides, fallback order, and smoke-test documentation (#359, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Dependencies: update the policy-eligible type-aware Oxlint release.
- Chrome extension: keep MiniMax Direct reasoning separate from visible streamed summaries (#354, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Chrome extension: route daemon Connect to actionable Runtime diagnostics for permissions, native-host failures, ports, and stale extension state (#352, #356; thanks @buhusa and @vincent-peng).
- Antigravity CLI: pass prompts through the required print argument with platform-safe size limits and prompt-safe errors (#357, thanks @mvance).
- Security: block private browser-media URLs in the extension and stop remote binary attachments from auto-enabling broad CLI tool permissions.
- Chrome extension: make User Scripts optional, omit debugger access from summary builds, and provide a separate debugger-enabled automation build.
- Loom: extract share/embed recording transcripts through yt-dlp with audio-capable format selection (#353, thanks @kartikkabadi).

## 0.21.3 - 2026-07-06

### Fixes

- Transcription: align CLI/docs with the runtime fallback order and preserve Gemini model overrides in installed daemons (#344, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Reddit extraction: retry verification-blocked threads through old Reddit and preserve the post plus comments in Markdown (#343, thanks @manfredlift).
- CLI slides: accept `--no-slides` and `--no-slides-ocr` so configured slide defaults can be disabled per run (#345, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Slides: bound optional calibration probes so the bundled FFmpeg fallback cannot stall for minutes when Node shutdown lingers.
- Daemon setup: report native messaging hosts installed for valid unpacked Chrome extension IDs instead of falsely marking them missing.

## 0.21.2 - 2026-07-04

### Fixes

- Chrome extension: keep the font picker value on one line with an ellipsis in narrow side panels and apply themed styles to password and URL fields.
- Chrome extension: connect daemon requests from the MV3 service worker directly to the native host so daemon-mode summaries work from the side panel.
- Chrome extension: keep YouTube requests on the daemon URL path when slides are enabled so browser transcripts do not suppress frame extraction.

## 0.21.1 - 2026-07-03

### Fixes

- Cache paths: keep non-slash tilde-prefixed paths relative instead of corrupting them during home-directory expansion (#338, thanks @fix2015).
- Deepgram transcription: preserve full media across failed OpenAI fallbacks and retain timestamped utterances through podcast and native YouTube paths.
- Dependencies: refresh the policy-eligible TypeScript native compiler preview and Node 24 typings.

## 0.21.0 - 2026-07-03

### Features

- Transcription: add Deepgram Nova as an opt-in media, podcast, and yt-dlp fallback with timestamped utterances (#335, thanks @orchidautomation).

## 0.20.2 - 2026-07-02

- Agent workflows: document outcome-focused prompts for transcribing and organizing larger video collections.
- Chrome extension: migrate the optional local companion to exact-ID Native Messaging, add managed `daemonAllowed` UX and browser-enforced enterprise blocking, and preserve Direct local-provider compatibility without sending those requests through the daemon bridge.

### Fixes

- Anthropic custom gateways: preserve path prefixes when sending PDF document requests (#325, thanks @wangwllu).
- Dependencies: use the latest policy-eligible `pi-ai` release so clean installs satisfy the seven-day minimum release age.
- Dependencies: refresh eligible browser media, typings, test, lint, formatting, and extension tooling releases.

## 0.20.1 - 2026-06-24

### Fixes

- Windows daemon: write Scheduled Task XML as BOM-marked UTF-16 so localized systems and non-ASCII user paths register reliably (#316, thanks @Zevan770).
- File inputs: parse `file:` URLs with Node's platform-aware conversion, including Windows drive and UNC paths (#318, thanks @vincent-peng).
- LLM summaries: retry transient API and pre-output streaming failures such as HTTP 502 instead of failing immediately.
- Dependencies: update eligible runtime, test, lint, formatting, and extension tooling releases.
- Chrome extension: allow Direct and Ollama hover summaries without a daemon token (#317, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Anthropic custom gateways: request adaptive thinking for synthetic models so Bedrock-compatible proxies accept configured reasoning (#321, thanks @wangwllu).

## 0.20.0 - 2026-06-19

### Features

- Chrome extension: allow the local daemon port to be configured under **Options → Runtime → Daemon**, with consistent routing for daemon calls and authenticated slide images (#312, thanks @enieuwy).

### Fixes

- Streaming: share EOF-safe, whitespace-preserving SSE parsing across core, CLI providers, and extension clients.
- Config: preserve standalone `enabled: false` values for cache, media cache, slides, and logging sections.
- Daemon chat: surface non-streaming provider failures and apply the GitHub Models compatibility fallback to JSON and SSE agent responses.
- Chrome extension: allow direct OpenAI provider mode to run hover summaries without requiring a daemon token.
- Dependencies: pin patched Vite, tmp, and protobufjs releases to clear known high- and moderate-severity transitive advisories.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-06-17

### Features

- Chrome extension: add Direct and Daemon AI connections with unified model selection; Auto uses configured direct providers or Gemini Nano on-device, while explicit Nano summaries remain local even with daemon capabilities enabled.
- Chrome extension: add direct provider-backed summaries, chat, automation, hover summaries, and URL extraction without the daemon, with independent AI and media runtimes plus local credentials for OpenAI, OpenRouter, Anthropic, Gemini, xAI, Z.AI, NVIDIA, MiniMax, GitHub Models, Ollama, and custom base URLs.

### Fixes

- Chrome extension: keep the default Direct/Gemini Nano experience immediately usable and show daemon performance and capability guidance as a compact dismissible hint.
- Chrome extension: preserve significant whitespace in SSE data fields while parsing daemon streams (#303, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Chrome extension: invoke Gemini Nano session methods with their native receiver so Browser summaries complete instead of silently falling back.
- Chrome extension slides: summarize each browser-extracted slide with Gemini Nano and cache CLI-compatible slide markers instead of showing raw transcript windows.
- Chrome extension slides: batch browser-extracted frames and transcript windows into one constrained multimodal Gemini Nano prompt, splitting only on context pressure and falling back safely when unavailable.
- Chrome extension slides: sample browser-captured frames across the full video duration so long videos include their final segment.
- Chrome extension: use Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano Summarizer API for daemonless Browser summaries when available, with first-use download progress and automatic extractive fallback.
- Remote transcripts: cap RSS and embedded caption response bodies at 5 MiB and cancel oversized streams. Thanks @Hinotoi-agent.
- Chrome extension: keep Direct mode's Gemini Nano path fully daemonless even with saved tokens, fail clearly when local extraction or transcription is unavailable, and hide chat and automation without a configured direct provider or authenticated daemon.

## 0.18.1 - 2026-06-13

### Fixes

- Podcast transcripts: allow Apple and Spotify RSS transcripts without requiring a local or cloud transcription provider.
- CLI cancellation: terminate tracked transcriber, downloader, and media-tool process trees on SIGINT or SIGTERM.
- Local media: accept configured Parakeet and Canary ONNX transcribers instead of rejecting them during provider preflight.
- Streaming: preserve repeated model deltas when a chunk exactly matches the accumulated summary.
- Daemon logging: expand `~` in configured log file paths instead of creating a literal working-directory path.
- Media cache: persist TTL pruning to the index after an expired-entry miss.
- Media cache: serialize index updates across concurrent daemon and CLI processes to prevent failed writes, lost entries, and orphaned files.
- Daemon chat: cancel CLI-backed agent processes when their HTTP client disconnects.
- Chrome extension: restore persisted chat history after the daemon agent-route refactor.
- CLI extraction: honor `--max-extract-characters` for remote text and document assets, not only web-page extraction.
- Cache: wait for concurrent first-open SQLite locks before enabling WAL instead of failing CLI startup with `database is locked`.
- Slides: honor explicit and configured scene thresholds without silently replacing them through auto-tuning.
- Slides: report the calibrated scene threshold in JSON and `slides.json` when interval fallback supplies frames after zero scene detections.
- Slides: render extracted slide labels or debug paths for `--slides --extract` even when a direct video has no transcript.
- CLI errors: print Commander validation failures and missing-input help once instead of duplicating them across stdout/stderr.
- Shell completions: sync and package Fish completions for both CLI aliases and subcommands, with candidate values matched to accepted CLI choices (#277, thanks @vincent-peng).
- Daemon: close live summarize and slide SSE connections immediately after terminal events instead of retaining them until session cleanup.
- Browser extension: declare User Scripts permissions per browser, route Chrome users to the required extension toggle, remove an invalid manifest permission, and align documented browser minimums.
- CLI video summaries: restore terminal and JSON output when direct video understanding delegates URL handling to the asset summarizer.
- Chrome extension: reject YouTube caption and transcript-panel results when the tab navigates to another video during extraction.
- Development CLI: load core workspace TypeScript sources directly for `pnpm summarize` and `pnpm s`, avoiding stale exports and concurrent rebuild races.
- Network safety: block private IPv4 targets embedded in the IPv4-translatable IPv6 prefix.
- Slides: ignore invalid zero-index slide markers without hanging while extracting slide references.
- Slides: support FFmpeg 4 scene detection by falling back to its legacy variable-frame-rate option.
- Summary length: use `long` as the built-in default across the CLI, daemon, and Chrome extension; explicit and configured lengths remain unchanged.
- YouTube captions: ignore WebVTT header metadata, cue identifiers, comments, styles, and regions when building transcripts.

## 0.18.0 - 2026-06-12

### Features

- Website media: detect a primary embedded YouTube video, use free captions automatically, and combine its transcript with substantial article text; add `--embedded-video auto|off|prefer|both`.
- CLI status: add `summarize status` with positive-only model/provider discovery, structured JSON, verbose details, and optional non-inference endpoint probes.

### Fixes

- Chrome extension: transcribe direct MP3/MP4 URLs without probing page media, cancel summary and chat work when panel sessions close, and clear daemon retry timers after failed requests.
- Codex CLI: pin bare and auto-fallback runs to GPT-5.5 instead of inheriting an older runtime default.
- Direct media: classify audio and video URLs from the pathname only so media-looking query strings and fragments do not reroute normal pages.
- Network fetches: keep body-consumption deadlines active alongside caller cancellation and preserve caller abort reasons instead of misreporting them as timeouts.
- URL fetch guard: block IPv4 documentation ranges while allowing public addresses elsewhere in 192.0.0.0/8.
- YouTube metadata: harden view-count freshness, fallbacks, embedded transcript cache identity, and timeout enforcement while reading response bodies.
- Chrome extension: update Transformers.js to 4.2 and resolve its bundled ONNX runtime assets through the installed dependency graph.

### Docs

- Contributing: add repository setup, checks, and pull-request guidance (thanks @zichen0116).

## 0.17.3 - 2026-06-11

### Features

- YouTube transcripts: include a timestamped public view count in structured extraction results and human transcript output, with a one-hour extraction cache window for mutable metrics.

### Fixes

- Diarization: extract local video audio once before upload and reuse the compact mono MP3 across ElevenLabs/OpenAI fallbacks instead of sending the full video container.
- YouTube diarization: download audio only unless slides are also requested; combined slide/diarization runs fetch separate audio and video streams once, reuse the video for slide extraction, and keep slide-only cache entries from replacing transcript audio.
- ElevenLabs diarization: let the configured ten-minute transcription deadline govern long recordings instead of Undici’s hidden five-minute response-header timeout.
- OpenAI diarization: split long recordings into bounded chunks with isolated speaker labels, timestamp offsets, rate-limit-aware retries, and automatic temporary-file cleanup.
- Speaker identification: preserve fair bounded evidence for long or malformed diarization turns, use model-compatible OpenAI options, and keep usage-less paid calls from reporting a false `$0` estimate.
- HTML extraction: normalize LinkeDOM HTML attribute names case-insensitively while preserving case-sensitive SVG and MathML attributes.

## 0.17.2 - 2026-06-11

### Features

- CLI media: allow `--diarize` and speaker identification for local and direct audio/video inputs, including MP3 and MP4, instead of limiting speaker-labelled transcription to YouTube.
- YouTube transcripts: fall back to Android VR direct audio resolution and configured transcription when `yt-dlp` is missing or fails, while preserving explicit `--youtube yt-dlp` and diarization requirements.
- Chrome extension: transcribe captionless YouTube videos without the daemon using active-player/watch-page or Android VR direct audio, captured SABR fallback, MediaBunny/WebCodecs, and browser-cached multilingual Whisper Tiny.
- Chrome extension: transcribe fetchable direct and embedded media without the daemon using ranged MediaBunny/WebCodecs decoding, bounded audio chunks, and an idle-evictable browser Whisper runtime.

### Fixes

- Chrome extension: cancel pending summary starts when switching tabs and recover from stalled WebGPU Whisper initialization with a bounded CPU fallback.
- CLI: use the Codex runtime default model instead of pinning auto fallback to an obsolete model.
- Daemon: defer cache shutdown until in-flight summary work drains, preventing late writes through finalized SQLite statements.
- Dependencies: replace Ora, tslog, and the FAL SDK with focused local implementations while retaining spinner, daemon logging, retry, multipart upload, and FAL transcription behavior.
- Chrome extension: replace the bundled browser FFmpeg WebAssembly runtime with MediaBunny and native WebCodecs, adding AV1 frame extraction while reducing the packaged extension size.
- Chrome extension: avoid throttled offscreen canvas blob callbacks so MediaBunny slide JPEGs encode in milliseconds instead of roughly one second per frame.
- YouTube media: prefer direct audio already exposed by the active player or watch page before requesting Android VR media, with resolver and browser decoder diagnostics in extension logs.
- Extension tests: load the Firefox build through Mozilla `web-ext` in CI and run daily live YouTube resolver plus daemonless Chrome transcription checks.

## 0.17.1 - 2026-06-11

### Fixes

- Pi CLI: pass summary prompts through private temporary file attachments because current Pi print mode does not read stdin.
- Dependencies: update Markdansi to 0.3.1 and refresh the dependency lockfile.
- Release: allow exact-version smoke tests to bypass the minimum release age for freshly published packages.

## 0.17.0 - 2026-06-11

### Features

- LLM providers: add native MiniMax models via the OpenAI-compatible API, keeping reasoning separate from summary text in streaming and non-streaming calls (#250, thanks @neeravmakwana).
- CLI providers: add pi CLI as `--cli pi` / `--model cli/pi`, with JSON-mode parsing, stdin prompts, configurable binary/model, and daemon/Chrome model picker support (#247, thanks @Youpen-y).
- Add Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a supported CLI provider. (#231, thanks @yetmike)
- CLI media: bundle an LGPL FFmpeg WebAssembly fallback for slide extraction and transcoding when native `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` are unavailable, while continuing to prefer native tools.
- Chrome extension: add a Browser slide runtime with bundled FFmpeg WebAssembly for daemonless video extraction, while keeping Daemon as an optional faster runtime.
- Chrome extension: persist Browser-mode summaries, slide text, transcripts, and thumbnails in Chrome storage for 30 days, with Runtime settings showing cache status and a clear button.
- Add `--diarize [auto|elevenlabs|openai]` for speaker-labelled YouTube transcripts using ElevenLabs Scribe v2 or OpenAI `gpt-4o-transcribe-diarize`.
- Add verified speaker naming for diarized YouTube transcripts with timestamp anchors, reusable profiles, transcript-hash-guarded mappings, GPT-5.5 context inference, and atomic `--remember-speakers` config updates.

### Fixes

- CLI cache: derive summary content hashes from binary attachment bytes so repeated local image summaries can hit the cache (#244, thanks @alfozan).
- YouTube transcripts: let `--diarize auto` and matching explicit provider requests reuse the same compatible cached speaker-labelled transcript instead of re-transcribing the same video.
- Dependencies: enforce a seven-day minimum release age and replace Cheerio/JSDOM HTML parsing with LinkeDOM, reducing the CLI production closure by 47 packages while preserving extraction behavior.
- Dependencies: replace the oversized tokenizer package with a compact o200k-compatible implementation and remove Zag from Chrome extension controls.
- DNS-pinned fetches: bypass Node environment proxies so validated IP addresses cannot be replaced by proxy-side DNS resolution.
- CLI cache: include local media `fileMtime` when writing transcript cache entries so repeated unchanged audio/video extraction can hit cache (#240, #241, thanks @alfozan).
- CLI: pass Codex image attachments to `codex exec` so local image summaries no longer fail before starting (#242, #243, thanks @alfozan).
- OpenAI-compatible gateways: honor `OPENAI_USE_CHAT_COMPLETIONS=false` and `openai.useChatCompletions=false` so custom base URLs can use the Responses API (#235, #236, thanks @mzbgf).
- RSS transcripts: block feed-controlled transcript URLs that target loopback, private, link-local, reserved, or redirected local-network addresses (#239, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- Podcast transcripts: cap remote media downloads at 512 MB by default, with a finite opt-in override for larger files (#237, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- Anthropic: forward explicit CLI `--thinking` to Anthropic text and streaming requests without leaking persisted OpenAI thinking defaults into non-OpenAI providers (#233, thanks @wangwllu).
- Chrome extension: abort stale side-panel summary streams on tab changes so delayed output from a closed or replaced tab cannot render under the new page title.
- Core: extract video IDs from YouTube `/live/` URLs so live and premiere links no longer abort summarization (#232, thanks @devYRPauli).
- Chrome extension: keep YouTube slide cards on the shared slide-summary path so local browser thumbnails receive the same summary text shape as CLI `--slides`.

## 0.16.3 - 2026-05-22

### Fixes

- Daemon: coalesce duplicate active summarize requests so sidebar retries/reconnects reuse the same stream instead of racing slide summary state.

## 0.16.2 - 2026-05-22

### Fixes

- Chrome extension: preserve sidebar scroll position while streamed summaries rerender so loading updates do not jump readers back to the top.
- Slides: seed planned slide timelines from transcript duration so YouTube slide summaries can start streaming before video frame extraction finishes.
- Chrome extension: keep partial streamed slide-summary fragments from blocking the final summary, so YouTube slide cards replace transcript snippets with the same slide summaries the CLI renders.
- Chrome extension: render slide-summary intro text above gallery cards and remove the duplicate Slides count heading so sidebar slide output matches the CLI shape.
- Release: harden npm publishing so raw `npm publish` is blocked, packed manifests reject `workspace:*`, and releases publish to `next` before exact-version smoke promotes `latest`.

## 0.16.1 - 2026-05-21

### Fixes

- Packaging: publish the CLI with a resolved `@steipete/summarize-core` dependency after `0.16.0` was published with workspace metadata.

## 0.16.0 - 2026-05-21

### Features

- Add Ollama as a first-class provider (`ollama/<model>`). Uses Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint (default `http://localhost:11434/v1`), no API key required, forces chat completions. Configurable via env `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` or config `ollama.baseUrl`. Daemon model picker auto-discovers Ollama models when `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` is set. See `docs/ollama.md`.

### Fixes

- CLI attachments: sanitize asset filenames before writing temp files so caller-supplied path components cannot escape the temp directory (#225, thanks @ejames-dev).
- CLI slides: keep local Ollama summaries from leaking planning text or malformed nested slide headings.
- Daemon: rate-limit repeated failed `/v1/*` bearer-token auth attempts with a bounded in-memory lockout (#227, thanks @ejames-dev).
- Daemon: use timing-safe bearer-token comparisons for local `/v1/*` authorization checks (#226, thanks @ejames-dev).
- Daemon: block daemon URL-mode extraction from fetching loopback, private-network, link-local, and redirect targets that resolve to local networks, and disable unguarded `yt-dlp` media fetches in guarded daemon URL runs.
- Chrome extension automation: require an extension-only native-input capability so page scripts cannot piggyback trusted input while automation is armed.
- Chrome extension: keep stale summarize stream starts from canceling newer streams after token lookup races.
- Chrome extension slides: request transcript context after restoring cached slides that do not include timed transcript text.
- Cache: clean generated slide artifacts when slide cache rows expire, evict, or clear.
- Release: align the release helper and docs with GitHub assets plus Homebrew/core verification instead of the retired tap flow.
- Daemon: cap concurrent summarize requests with an env-tunable limit so runaway extension/API clients receive a clear 429 instead of piling up background work.
- Chrome extension: allow max-size page extraction payloads to reach the daemon instead of failing JSON body parsing before summarization starts.
- CLI streaming: write interactive raw summary deltas as soon as they arrive instead of waiting for a newline before the first stdout output.
- Chrome extension: stream OpenAI GPT-5 summaries with fast/reasoning options instead of waiting for a blocking completion.
- Chrome extension: move the summary copy action into the header toolbar instead of reserving space above the rendered summary.
- Chrome extension automation: avoid duplicate content-script listeners when automation is injected more than once into the same tab.
- Chrome extension options: keep slower process-log responses from overwriting the logs for a newly selected process.
- Chrome extension: keep stale model discovery responses from reverting newer token results or user-selected models.
- Chrome extension options: keep stale daemon status checks from replacing the missing-token warning after the token field is cleared.
- Chrome extension options: show save failures instead of leaving the form stuck on Saving.
- CLI performance: skip remote asset probes for normal web URLs so extraction reaches first stdout sooner while preserving unknown-asset fallback after URL extraction failures.
- YouTube transcripts: try same-language caption fallbacks when the preferred caption URL is blocked or dead.
- Chrome extension: match CLI slide defaults for YouTube slide summaries and replace transcript fallback card text with LLM-written slide summaries.
- Chrome extension: render YouTube slide summaries through the shared CLI slide parser and coalesce duplicate slide summarize starts.
- Chrome extension options: defer loading automation skills until the Skills tab opens so settings startup avoids the large skills bundle.
- Chrome extension: make picker popovers opaque again and reorganize advanced options into clearer groups.
- Chrome extension options: avoid crashing when Chrome opens settings without the extension storage API available.

## 0.15.2 - 2026-05-17

### Fixes

- CLI streaming: fall back to non-streaming summaries when a stream iterator times out before yielding text, without marking slide streaming complete on failed partial output.
- Core prompts: escape untrusted prompt context/content delimiters and make sponsor-only slide instructions compatible with mandatory slide headings.
- Link preview: reject unsafe direct-video URL schemes, detect YouTube privacy-enhanced embeds, and avoid stripping visible inline text with similar CSS property/value prefixes.
- Slides: reject traversal and symlinked cache image paths while preserving valid child paths that start with dot-dot text.
- Chrome extension: flush final SSE events when streams close without a blank delimiter.
- Tests: include `packages/core/src` in coverage collection so core package regressions affect the gate.

## 0.15.1 - 2026-05-15

### Fixes

- Packaging: publish the CLI with a resolved core package dependency so registry installs work outside the workspace.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-05-15

### Features

- CLI providers: add GitHub Copilot CLI as `--cli copilot` / `--model cli/copilot`, including config, auto fallback, daemon model discovery, and Chrome extension settings (#211, thanks @izecell).
- CLI extraction: fall back to OpenAI vision OCR for image-only PDFs when markitdown returns only page headers, so `--extract` and forced preprocessing can recover scanned PDF text (#204, thanks @mvance).

### Fixes

- Test/release gates: ignore local Clawpatch metadata during format checks, align Node typings with the Node 24 engine floor, and cover media path/cache wiring.
- Test gates: wire `VITEST_MAX_THREADS` through Vitest 4 `maxWorkers` and add package bin/script regression coverage.
- Dependencies: update workspace packages and replace deprecated `@mariozechner/pi-ai` with `@earendil-works/pi-ai`.
- CLI performance: add opt-in startup/first-output tracing and avoid network LiteLLM catalog refreshes on fixed-model summary streaming and finish-line cost estimation.
- Chrome extension slides: harden slide payload loading against malformed cache/stream data and clear stale thumbnails before retrying updated slide images.
- Release gate: run `pnpm typecheck` during `pnpm check` so CI/release checks catch TypeScript errors.
- Typecheck: include `packages/core` in the root typecheck script so core library errors fail the gate.
- Tests: ignore invalid `VITEST_MAX_THREADS` overrides so Vitest never receives `maxThreads` below `minThreads`.
- CLI version: stop baking a stale git SHA into the committed `dist/cli.js` wrapper so checkout builds report the current commit.
- Chrome extension: keep local-video slide E2E shutdown from hanging, reject malformed media durations and non-video YouTube container URLs, and sanitize invalid advanced settings before they reach daemon requests.
- Parsing: reject non-decimal timestamp hrefs, malformed transcript clocks, malformed podcast durations, and non-decimal slide/retry numeric settings.
- Timestamps: reject malformed transcript, key-moment, slide, summary, and side-panel chat timestamps before they become prompt context or seek links.
- Slides: wait for background slide extraction to finish before URL flows exit, avoiding late cache writes during daemon shutdown.
- Daemon slides: ignore request-provided slide output directories and keep extracted slide artifacts under `~/.summarize/slides` (#220, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- Chrome extension automation: require confirmation before side-panel agent automation tools run, and report cancelled calls without applying navigation side effects (#219, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- Chrome extension automation: guard the artifacts bridge so browser JS can only read or write artifacts while extension-owned automation has armed the tab (#222, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- Chrome extension hover: ignore synthetic hover events and block hover summaries for localhost, private-network, link-local, and non-HTTP(S) URLs (#218, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- Refresh-free: keep `~/.summarize/config.json` rewrites and their config directory owner-only when updating free model candidates (#217, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- CLI progress: keep Ctrl+C responsive while spinners are active and forward interrupts to active CLI model backends so child processes are not left running (#216).
- Codex CLI: isolate normal summary runs with `--ephemeral`, `--ignore-user-config`, `--ignore-rules`, a temporary cwd, and a sanitized temporary `CODEX_HOME` so local Codex context cannot bleed into summaries with little or no extracted content (#215, thanks @anntnzrb).
- Daemon: write `~/.summarize/daemon.json` with owner-only permissions and tighten existing config paths before rewriting daemon tokens or captured provider env values (#214, thanks @Hinotoi-agent).
- GitHub Models: ignore OpenAI-only request options such as `openai.thinking` / `--thinking` for `github-copilot/...` calls so Copilot summaries do not fail with GitHub Models `400` errors.
- Google document summaries: send `temperature` and `maxOutputTokens` inside Gemini `generationConfig` for document requests, and include API error details when Google rejects the payload (#209, thanks @vincent-peng).

## 0.14.1 - 2026-04-26

### Features

- Models: add OpenAI fast-service support via `--fast` / `--service-tier` and `--thinking`, keep `gpt-fast` / `fast` as compatibility aliases, and add explicit `codex-fast` for Codex CLI users.

- CLI extraction: support `--extract` for local PDF files through the existing markitdown preprocessing path, without requiring an LLM (#203, thanks @mvance).

### Fixes

- CLI auto models: include config-provided environment values when selecting `auto` candidates, so API keys in `~/.summarize/config.json` are honored for URL summaries (#206, fixes #205, thanks @kaihendry and @solomonneas).
- Chrome extension: skip always-on content scripts on Facebook, Instagram, and Meta CDN pages to avoid site compatibility issues (#208, fixes #106, thanks @solomonneas).

- Chrome extension chat: isolate side-panel chat history by both tab and URL so navigating within a tab no longer shows another page's conversation (#189, thanks @Youpen-y).
- Chrome extension chat: honor `openai.useChatCompletions` for side-panel chat requests, including fixed and auto-selected OpenAI models (#155, thanks @Zevan770).
- Spotify podcasts: skip encrypted Spotify embed audio, fall back to publisher RSS enclosures, and surface podcast transcription failures instead of summarizing a bare URL.
- X extraction: surface unauthorized `xurl` responses with actionable auth/fallback guidance when Nitter is unavailable (#200, thanks @coygeek).
- OpenClaw CLI: call current OpenClaw with `-m/--message` and reject oversized prompts before hitting argv limits (#199, thanks @Silver-Aurora).
- Windows daemon: register the logon Scheduled Task via XML with battery-safe hidden launch settings, fix restart/uninstall process cleanup, and document the Administrator install flow (#192, thanks @ajmeese7).
- CLI providers: use stable default aliases for Gemini (`flash`) and Cursor Agent (`auto`) so installed CLI versions resolve supported models reliably (#193, thanks @mvance).
- CLI build: mark the generated `dist/cli.js` wrapper executable so `npm link` and global installs can run the binary directly on Unix-like systems (#191, thanks @maciej).
- CLI progress: show only the active transcription provider/model in status text instead of the full remote fallback chain.

## 0.13.0 - 2026-04-08

- Media detection/cache: recognize `.m3u8` HLS playlists as direct media inputs and preserve the playlist extension in the media cache (#159, thanks @mdsakalu).

### Fixes

- OpenAI models: route GPT-5.4 / GPT-5.4 mini / GPT-5.4 nano / GPT-5 mini / GPT-5 nano text requests through direct provider APIs instead of the stale generic parser, preserve the real `gpt-5.4-mini` / `gpt-5.4-nano` ids end-to-end, and fall GitHub Models OpenAI GPT-5-family requests back to `gpt-5-chat` when GitHub rejects the raw id.
- GitHub Models: make `github-copilot/...` shorthand inference family-based instead of pinning old exact prefixes, so newer ids like `gpt-5.4`, `o5`, and `claude-opus-4.6` normalize correctly when the backend exposes them.
- Slides/local video: transcribe direct videos for slide summaries, avoid fake local-file “Downloading audio” phases, and keep progress text visible while slide extraction runs.
- Chrome extension slides: restore slide text/session state more reliably so reruns and reloads do not leave stale or blank slide summaries.
- Transcription: retry Groq Whisper uploads via `curl` when Node multipart uploads get a 403, fixing local `.ogg` regressions on some environments.
- YouTube: detect obviously truncated caption-track transcripts on long videos and fall through to yt-dlp transcription instead of caching a broken partial result (#184, thanks @sportiz91).
- YouTube: treat yt-dlp “no audio stream” videos as a non-fatal unavailable transcript case so summarize can continue cleanly with an explanatory note (#161, thanks @mdsakalu).
- Cache: include the prompt `<context>` block in summary cache hashing and bump the cache format version so stale cross-page summary collisions cannot be reused (#171, thanks @mvance).
- CLI providers: stream OpenClaw prompts over stdin instead of `--message`, make daemon side-panel chat honor `openai.useChatCompletions`/custom OpenAI-compatible base URLs, and stop leaking raw Codex JSONL events like `thread.started` when no assistant text was produced.
- Chrome extension: add a copy button for rendered summaries so results can be copied without manual selection.
- Chrome extension chat: handle plain-string assistant replies in the side-panel agent loop instead of crashing on `.filter()` tool-call extraction (#186, thanks @Youpen-y).
- Windows containers: let `summarize daemon install` start the daemon for the current container session without Scheduled Task registration, keep `0.0.0.0` binding Windows-only, and probe slide tools by spawning commands when PATH lookup is unreliable (#152, thanks @mathicg).
- Windows daemon: keep Scheduled Task startup hidden without breaking `summarize daemon restart` or uninstall by tracking the hidden daemon PID and killing that process tree before reruns/removal (#146, thanks @mathicg).
- Whisper.cpp: honor config-resolved transcription env overrides for readiness checks, model display, and local transcription so custom binary/model paths work outside `process.env` (#160, thanks @mdsakalu).
- Daemon models: gracefully fall back for unrecognized custom models when using proxy base URLs instead of crashing on undefined API metadata (#175, thanks @douo).
- Docs/setup: switch Homebrew instructions from the old tap to the official `brew install summarize` formula, including the side-panel setup UI and release checklist (#172, thanks @zeldrisho).
- Chrome extension: detect blank `userAgentData.platform` browsers like Vivaldi by falling back to `navigator.platform` before choosing OS-specific setup instructions (#158, thanks @bytrangle).
- Firecrawl: reject `--firecrawl always` for YouTube URLs with an explicit guidance error instead of silently skipping Firecrawl on the transcript-first path (#145, thanks @steipete).
- YouTube: keep Gemini-only no-caption runs on the transcription path by forwarding the Google API key from the top-level URL flow into link-preview transcription config (#148, thanks @bytrangle).
- Homebrew: make the tap formula fail clearly on Linux instead of installing a macOS binary, and add generator/test coverage for the macOS-only guard (#147, thanks @steipete).
- Maintenance: update the GitHub Pages workflow to `actions/configure-pages@v6` and `actions/deploy-pages@v5` (#182, thanks @dependabot).

### Fixes

- Transcription: add AssemblyAI as a first-class remote provider across direct media, podcast/RSS, and yt-dlp YouTube fallback; refactor remote fallback ordering, expand config/env support (`ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY`, legacy `apiKeys.assemblyai`), and add AssemblyAI unit + live coverage (#126).
- X/Twitter: prefer `xurl` for tweet extraction when installed, fall back to `bird`, preserve long-form/article text plus media URLs, add live `xurl` extraction/media coverage, and replace the stale dead-`bird` install tip with a current X CLI recommendation (#70).
- Models: make daemon agent `artifacts` schemas Gemini-safe, improve Google empty-response handling with preview-to-stable fallback, and switch CLI/auto Gemini defaults away from brittle preview behavior (#82, #96).

- Chrome extension: refactor side-panel navigation/run attachment policy so late summary/slide runs no longer attach to the wrong page after tab or URL switches, and expand headless regression coverage for pending-run resume and slide-mode transitions.
- Chrome extension: default fresh installs to slide mode, keep passive tab navigation out of chat, and align slide cards with CLI `--slides` by preferring per-slide summary text over raw transcript/OCR fallback.
- Chrome extension tests: add stronger YouTube slide E2E coverage for loaded images, summary-backed slide text, and switching between videos mid-analysis without stale slide-summary bleed.
- Chrome extension: isolate slide-summary stream callbacks per run and harden Playwright settings hydration so late events no longer blank slide text when switching videos mid-analysis.
- Transcription: add Gemini audio/video transcription support across direct media, podcast/RSS, and yt-dlp YouTube fallback, including Files API uploads for larger media plus new Gemini live coverage (#89).
- npm packaging: publish CLI with `pnpm publish` so `@steipete/summarize-core` is version-pinned in published metadata (no `workspace:*` in registry package).
- Slides: detect WezTerm as an iTerm-compatible terminal for inline slide images in `--slides` mode. (#133) — thanks @doodaaatimmy-creator.
- CLI help: surface `summarize refresh-free` in `summarize help` output.

- Release: build macOS x64 Bun artifacts and add regression coverage for Homebrew formula rewrites during dual-arch releases (#122, thanks @androidshu).
- YouTube: tighten hostname validation across core, slides, and extension helpers so attacker-controlled lookalike hosts are no longer treated as YouTube URLs (#91, thanks @RinZ27).
- Config: honor `zai.baseUrl` config fallback for blank env values and keep Z.AI base URL overrides working outside the summary flow (#102, thanks @liuy).
- Chrome extension: tighten options and sidepanel UI spacing, copy actions, and advanced-controls layout for a cleaner panel experience (#86, thanks @morozRed).
- Slides: warn in summary mode when `--slides` dependencies are missing, and document required local installs for `ffmpeg`, `yt-dlp`, and optional `tesseract`.
- Docs: fix broken docs index links by setting an empty Jekyll `baseurl` (#113, thanks @Youpen-y).
- Models: preserve model id casing after the provider prefix so OpenAI-compatible proxies can route exact names correctly (#128, thanks @WinnCook).
- Cache: give extract entries with unavailable transcripts the same short retry TTL as negative transcript cache entries, so transient Apify failures can recover (#115, thanks @gluneau).
- Daemon: apply the saved env snapshot to `process.env` before `daemon run` starts so child tools inherit the right PATH and API/tool config under launchd/systemd (#99, thanks @heyalchang).
- Chrome automation: require sidepanel arming before debugger-backed native input can run in a tab, and auto-disarm after browser JS execution ends (#129, thanks @omnicoder9).
- Media setup: fix the local whisper.cpp install hint to use the current Homebrew formula name `whisper-cpp` (#92, thanks @zerone0x).
- CLI output: cap markdown render width on very wide terminals by default, with a `--width` override for manual control (#119, thanks @howardpen9).
- Slides: size inline slide images from terminal width instead of keeping them pinned to 32 columns, capped at 2x the previous width while preserving `COLUMNS` fallback behavior (#125, #135, thanks @WinnCook).
- Shell completions: add Fish shell completions for the current CLI flags and option values (#95, thanks @fbehrens).

## 0.11.0 - 2026-02-14

### Highlights

- Auto CLI fallback: new controls and persisted last-success provider state (`~/.summarize/cli-state.json`) for no-key/local-CLI workflows.
- Transcription reliability: Groq Whisper is now the preferred cloud transcriber, with custom OpenAI-compatible Whisper endpoint overrides.
- Input reliability: binary-safe stdin handling, local media support in `--extract`, and fixes for local-file hangs/PDF preprocessing on custom OpenAI base URLs.

### Features

- CLI: add Cursor Agent provider (`--cli agent`) for CLI-model execution.
- CLI auto mode: add implicit auto CLI fallback controls (`cli.autoFallback`, `--auto-cli-fallback`) and provider priority controls (`cli.providers`, `--cli-priority`), with persisted provider success ordering.
- Transcription: add Groq Whisper as preferred cloud provider (#71, thanks @n0an).
- Transcription: support custom OpenAI-compatible Whisper endpoints via `OPENAI_WHISPER_BASE_URL` (with safe `OPENAI_BASE_URL` fallback) (#65, thanks @toanbot).
- Config: support generic `env` defaults in `~/.summarize/config.json` (fallback for any env var), while keeping legacy `apiKeys` mapping for compatibility (#63, thanks @entropyy0).

### Fixes

- CLI local files: avoid hangs when stream usage never resolves and preprocess PDFs automatically for custom OpenAI-compatible `OPENAI_BASE_URL` endpoints (e.g. non-`api.openai.com`).
- CLI stdin: support binary-safe piping/input temp files to prevent corruption on non-text stdin (#76).
- Extract mode: allow `--extract` for local media files (#72).
- Auto model/daemon fallback: skip model attempts when required API keys are missing and normalize env-key checks in daemon fallback (#67, #78).
- Cache: for auto presets (`auto`/`free`/named auto), prefer preset-level winner cache entries so stale per-candidate cache hits don’t override newer better-model results.
- Media: treat X broadcasts (`/i/broadcasts/...`) as transcript-first media and prefer URL mode.
- YouTube: keep explicit `--youtube apify` working when HTML fetch fails, while preserving duration metadata parity (#64, thanks @entropyy0).
- Transcription: stabilize Groq-first fallback flow (no duplicate Groq retries in file mode), improve terminal error reporting, and surface Groq setup in media guidance (#71, thanks @n0an).
- Media detection: detect more direct media URL extensions including `.ogg`/`.opus` (#65, thanks @toanbot).
- Slides: allow yt-dlp cookies-from-browser via `SUMMARIZE_YT_DLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER` to avoid YouTube 403s.
- Daemon install: resolve symlinked/global bin paths and Windows shims when locating the CLI for install (#57, #62, thanks @entropyy0).
- Extraction: strip hidden HTML + invisible Unicode before summarization or extract output (#61).
- CLI: honor `--lang` for YouTube transcript→Markdown conversion in `--markdown-mode llm` (#56, thanks @entropyy0).
- LLM: map Anthropic bare model ids to versioned aliases (`claude-sonnet-4` → `claude-sonnet-4-0`) (#55, thanks @entropyy0).

### Improvements

- Tooling: remove Biome and standardize on `oxfmt` + type-aware `oxlint`; `pnpm check` now enforces `format:check` before lint/tests.
- Dependencies: update workspace dependencies to latest (including `@mariozechner/pi-ai` and `oxlint-tsgolint`).

## 0.10.0 - 2026-01-22

- Chrome Side Panel chat: timestamped transcript context plus clickable `[mm:ss]` links that seek the current media.
- Slides: extract slide screenshots + OCR for YouTube/direct video URLs in the CLI + extension (#41, thanks @philippb).
- Slides: top-of-summary slide strip with expand/collapse full-width cards, timestamps, and click-to-seek.
- Slides: slide descriptions without model calls (transcript windowing, OCR fallback) + OCR/Transcript toggle.
- Slides: stream slide extraction status/progress and show a single header progress bar (no duplicate spinners).
- CLI: transcribe local audio/video files with mtime-aware transcript cache invalidation (thanks @mvance!).
- Browser extension: add Firefox sidebar build + multi-browser config (#31, thanks @vlnd0).
- CLI: add Cursor Agent CLI provider (`cli/agent`, `--cli agent`).
- Chrome automation: add artifacts tool + REPL helpers for persistent session files (notes/JSON/CSV) and downloads.
- Chrome automation: expand navigate tool with list/switch tab support and return matching skills after navigation.

### Fixes

- Extract-only: remove implicit 8k cap; new `--max-extract-characters`/daemon `maxExtractCharacters` allow opt-in limits; resolves transcript truncation.
- Media: route direct media URLs to the transcription pipeline and raise the local media limit to 2GB (#47, thanks @n0an).
- Daemon (macOS): `daemon install` now falls back from `launchctl bootstrap gui/<uid>` to `user/<uid>` and resolves sudo/root uid targeting to avoid bootstrap `Input/output error` / `Domain does not support specified action` failures (#75).
- Slides: allow yt-dlp cookies-from-browser via `SUMMARIZE_YT_DLP_COOKIES_FROM_BROWSER` to avoid YouTube 403s.
- Chrome Side Panel chat: support JSON agent replies with explicit SSE/JSON negotiation to avoid “stream ended” errors.
- Chrome Side Panel: scope streams/state per window so other windows don’t wipe active summaries.
- Chrome Side Panel chat: keep auto-scroll pinned while streaming when you’re already at the bottom.
- Chrome Side Panel chat: clear streaming placeholders on errors/aborts.
- Chrome Side Panel: add inline error toast above chat composer; errors stay visible when scrolled.
- Chrome Side Panel: clear/hide the inline error toast when no message is present to avoid empty red boxes.
- Cache: include transcript timestamp requests in extract cache keys so timed summaries don’t reuse plain transcript content.
- CLI: `--no-cache` now bypasses summary caching only; transcript/media caches still apply.
- Media: treat X broadcasts (`/i/broadcasts/...`) as transcript-first media and prefer URL mode.
- Daemon: avoid URL flow crashes when url-preference helpers are missing (ReferenceError guard).
- YouTube: prefer English caption variants (`en-*`) when selecting caption tracks.
- Prompts: ignore sponsor/ads segments in video and podcast summaries.
- Prompts: enforce no-ads/no-skipped language and italicized standout excerpts (no quotation marks).
- Slides: render Slide X/Y labels and parse slide markers more robustly in streaming output.
- Slides: parse `Slide N/Total` labels and stabilize title/body extraction.
- Slides: ensure slide summary segments start with a title line when missing.
- Slides: detect headline-style first lines and render them as slide titles (no required `Title:` markers).
- Slides: progress updates during yt-dlp downloads and OSC progress mirrors slide extraction.
- Slides: reuse the media cache for downloaded videos (even with `--no-cache`).
- Slides: clear slide progress line before the finish summary to avoid stray `Slides x/y` output.
- CLI status line: ignore empty/ANSI-only spinner updates and duplicate texts to prevent flicker/blank status frames.
- Automation: require userScripts (no isolated-world fallback), with improved guidance and in-panel permission notice.
- CLI: clear OSC progress on SIGINT/SIGTERM to avoid stuck indicators.
- CLI local files: avoid hangs when stream usage never resolves and preprocess PDFs automatically for custom OpenAI-compatible `OPENAI_BASE_URL` endpoints (e.g. non-`api.openai.com`).

### Improvements

- Tooling: remove Biome and standardize on `oxfmt` + type-aware `oxlint`; `pnpm check` now enforces `format:check` before lint/tests.
- Transcription: add auto transcriber selection (default) with ONNX-first when configured + `summarize transcriber setup`.
- Cache: add media download caching with TTL/size caps + optional verification, plus `--no-media-cache`.
- CLI: add themed output (24-bit ANSI), `--theme`, and config/env defaults for a consistent color scheme.
- CLI: show determinate transcription progress percent when duration is known.
- CLI: show determinate OSC progress for transcription/download when totals are known.
- CLI: keep OSC progress determinate when recent percent updates are available.
- CLI: theme transcription progress lines and mirror part-based progress to OSC when duration is unknown.
- CLI: theme tweet/extraction progress lines for consistent loading indicators.
- CLI: theme file/slide spinner labels so all progress lines share the same styling.
- CLI: simplify media download labels (avoid “media, video” duplication).
- Slides: cap auto slide targets at 6 by default for long videos.
- Slides: render headline-style first lines as slide titles above the slide marker.
- Media: refactor routing helpers and size policy (#48, thanks @steipete).
- Daemon: emit slides start/progress/done metadata in extended logging for easier debugging.
- Prompts: allow straight quotes and encourage 1-2 short exact quotes when relevant.

### Docs

- README: 0.10.0 preview layout with clearer install flow, daemon rationale, and prominent Chrome Web Store link.
- README/docs: add UI theme config + ONNX install hints.
- README: document ONNX transcriber setup + auto selection.

## 0.9.0 - 2025-12-31

### Highlights

- Chrome Side Panel: **Chat mode** with metrics bar, message queue, and improved context (full transcript + summary metadata, jump-to-latest, smoother auto-scroll).
- Media-aware summarization in the Side Panel: Page vs Video/Audio dropdown, automatic media preference on video sites, plus visible word count/duration.
- Chrome extension: optional hover tooltip summaries for links (advanced setting, default off; experimental) with prompt customization.

### Improvements

- PDF + asset handling: send PDFs directly to Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini when supported; generic PDF attachments and better media URL detection.
- Daemon: `/v1/chat` + `extractOnly`, version in health/status pill, optional JSON log with rotation, and more resilient restart/install health checks.
- Side Panel: advanced model row with “Scan free” (shows top free model after scan), a refresh summary control (cache bypass), plus richer length tooltips.
- Side Panel UX: consolidated advanced layout and typography controls (font size A/AA, line-height), streamlined setup panel with inline copy, clearer status text, and tighter model/length controls.
- Side Panel UX: keep the Auto summarize toggle on one line in Advanced.
- Streaming/metrics polish: faster stream flushes, shorter OpenRouter labels on wrap, and improved extraction metadata in chat.

### Fixes

- Auto model selection: OpenRouter fallback now resolves provider-specific ids (dash/dot slug normalization) and skips fallback when no unique match.
- Language auto: default to English when detection is uncertain.
- OpenAI GPT-5: skip `temperature` in streaming requests to avoid 400s for unsupported params.
- Side Panel stability: retryable stream errors, no abort crash, auto-summarize on open/source switch, synced chat toggle state, and caret alignment.
- YouTube duration handling: player API/HTML/yt-dlp fallbacks, transcript metadata propagation, and extension duration fallbacks.
- URL extraction: preserve final redirected URLs so shorteners (t.co) summarize the real destination.
- Hover summaries: proxy localhost daemon calls to avoid Chrome “Local network access” prompts.
- Install: use npm releases for osc-progress/tokentally instead of git deps.

## 0.8.2 - 2025-12-28

### Breaking

- ESM-only: `@steipete/summarize` + `@steipete/summarize-core` no longer support CommonJS `require()`; the CLI binary is now ESM.

### Highlights

- Chrome: add a real **Side Panel** extension (MV3) that summarizes the **current tab** and renders streamed Markdown.
- Daemon: add `summarize daemon …` (localhost server on `127.0.0.1:8787`) for extension ↔ CLI integration.
  - Autostart: macOS LaunchAgent, Linux systemd user service, Windows Scheduled Task
  - Token pairing (shared secret)
  - Streaming over SSE
  - Emit finish-line metrics over SSE (panel footer + hover details)
  - Commands: `install`, `status`, `restart`, `uninstall`, `run`
- Cache: add SQLite cache for transcripts/extractions/summaries with `--no-cache`, `--cache-stats`, `--clear-cache` + config (`cache.enabled/maxMb/ttlDays/path`).
  - Finish line shows “Cached” for summary cache hits (CLI + daemon/extension)
  - Daemon/Chrome stream cache status metadata (`summaryFromCache`)

### Features

- YouTube: add `--youtube no-auto` to skip auto-generated captions and prefer creator-uploaded captions; fall back to `yt-dlp` transcription (thanks @dougvk!).
- CLI: add transcript → Markdown formatting via `--extract --format md --markdown-mode llm` (thanks @dougvk!).
- X/Twitter: auto-transcribe tweet videos via `yt-dlp`, using browser cookies (Chrome → Safari → Firefox) when available; set `TWITTER_COOKIE_SOURCE` / `TWITTER_*_PROFILE` to control cookie extraction order.
- Prompt overrides: add `--prompt`, `--prompt-file`, and config `prompt` to replace the default summary instructions.
- Chrome Side Panel: add length + language controls (presets + custom), forwarded to the daemon.
- Daemon API: `mode: "auto"` accepts both `url` + extracted page `text`; daemon picks the best pipeline (YouTube/podcasts/media → URL, otherwise prefer visible page text) with a fallback attempt.
- Daemon/Chrome: stream extra run metadata (`inputSummary`, `modelLabel`) over SSE for richer panel status.
- Core: expose lightweight URL helpers at `@steipete/summarize-core/content/url` (YouTube/Twitter/podcast/direct-media detection).
- Chrome Side Panel: new icon + extension `homepage_url` set to `summarize.sh`.
- Providers: add configurable API base URLs (config + env) for OpenAI/Anthropic/Google/xAI (thanks @bunchjesse for the nudge).

### Fixes

- Packaging: ensure runtime deps and core tarball are included in published CLI bundles.

### Improvements

- Chrome Side Panel: stream SSE from the panel (no MV3 background stalls), use runtime messaging to avoid “disconnected port” errors, and improve auto-summarize de-dupe.
- Chrome Side Panel UI: working status in header + 1px progress line (no layout jump), full-width subtitle, page title in header, idle subtitle shows `words/chars` (or media duration + words) + model, subtle metrics footer, continuous background, and native highlight/link accents.
- Daemon: prefer the installed env snapshot over launchd’s minimal environment (improves `yt-dlp` / `whisper.cpp` PATH reliability, especially for X/Twitter video transcription).
- X/Twitter: cookie handling now delegates to `yt-dlp --cookies-from-browser` (no sweet-cookie dependency).
- X/Twitter: skip yt-dlp transcript attempts for long-form tweet text (articles).
- Transcripts: show yt-dlp download progress bytes and stabilize totals to prevent bouncing progress bars.
- Finish line: show transcript source labels (`YouTube` / `podcast`) without repeating the label.
- Streaming: stop/clear progress UI before first streamed output and avoid leading blank lines on non-TTY stdout.
- URL flow: propagate `extracted.truncated` into the prompt context so summaries can reflect partial inputs.
- Daemon: unify URL/page summarization with the CLI flows (single code path; keeps extract/cache/model logic in sync).
- Prompts: auto-require Markdown section headings for longer summaries (xl/xxl or large custom lengths).

## 0.7.1 - 2025-12-26

### Fixed

- Packaging: `@steipete/summarize-core` now ships a CJS build for `require()` consumers (fixes `pnpm dlx @steipete/summarize --help` and the published CLI runtime).

## 0.7.0 - 2025-12-26

### Highlights

- Packages: split into `@steipete/summarize-core` (library) + `@steipete/summarize` (CLI; depends on core). Versions are lockstep.
- Streaming: scrollback-safe Markdown streaming (hybrid: line-by-line + block buffering for fenced code + tables). No cursor control, no full-frame redraws.
- Output: Markdown rendering is automatic on TTY; use `--plain` for raw Markdown/text output.
- Finish line: compact separators (`·`) and no duplicated `… words` when transcript stats are shown.
- YouTube: `--youtube auto` prefers `yt-dlp` transcription when available; Apify is last-last resort.

### Fixed

- Streaming: flush newline-bounded output in `--plain` mode to avoid duplication with cumulative stream chunks.
- Website extraction: strip inline CSS before Readability to avoid extremely slow jsdom stylesheet parsing on some pages.
- Twitter/X: rotate Nitter hosts and skip Anubis PoW pages during tweet fallback.

### Changed

- CLI: remove `--render`; add `--plain` to keep raw output (no ANSI/OSC rendering).

## 0.6.1 - 2025-12-25

### Changes

- YouTube: `--youtube auto` now falls back to `yt-dlp` if it’s on `PATH` (or `YT_DLP_PATH` is set) and a Whisper provider is available.
- `--version` now includes a short git SHA when available (build provenance).
- `--extract` now defaults to Markdown output (when `--format` is omitted), preferring Readability input.
- `--extract` no longer spends LLM tokens for Markdown conversion by default (unless `--markdown-mode llm` is used).
- `--format md` no longer forces Firecrawl; use `--firecrawl always` to force it.
- Finish line in `--extract` shows the extraction path (e.g. `markdown via readability`) and omits noisy `via html` output.
- Finish line always includes the model id when an LLM is used (including `--extract --markdown-mode llm`).
- `--extract` renders Markdown in TTY output (same renderer as summaries) when `--render auto|md` (use `--render plain` for raw Markdown).
- Suppress transcript progress/failure messages for non-YouTube / non-podcast URLs.
- Streaming now works with auto-selected models (including `--model free`) when `--stream on|auto`.
- Warn when `--length` is explicitly provided with `--extract` (ignored; no summary is generated).

## 0.6.0 - 2025-12-25

### Features

- **Podcasts (full episodes)**
  - Support Apple Podcasts episode URLs via iTunes Lookup + enclosure transcription (avoids slow/blocked HTML).
  - Support Spotify episode URLs via the embed page (`/embed/episode/...`) to avoid recaptcha; fall back to iTunes RSS when embed audio is DRM/missing.
  - Prefer local `whisper.cpp` when installed + model available (no API keys required for transcription).
  - Whisper transcription works for any media URL (audio/video containers), not just YouTube.
- **Language**
  - Add `--language/--lang` (default: `auto`, match source language).
  - Add config support via `output.language` (legacy `language` still supported).
- **Progress UI**
  - Add two-phase progress for podcasts: media download + Whisper transcription progress.
  - Show transcript phases (YouTube caption/Apify/yt-dlp), provider + model, and media size/duration.

### Changes

- **Transcription**
  - Add lenient ffmpeg transcode fallback for local Whisper when strict decode fails (e.g. Spotify AAC).

- **Models**
  - Add `zai/...` model alias with Z.AI base URL + chat completions by default.
  - Add `OPENAI_USE_CHAT_COMPLETIONS` + `openai.useChatCompletions` config toggle.
- **Metrics / output**
  - `--metrics on|detailed`: finish line includes compact transcript stats (… words, …) + media duration (when available); `--metrics detailed`: also prints input/transcript sizes + transcript source/provider/cache; hides `calls=1`.
  - Smarter duration formatting (`1h 13m 4s`, `44s`) and rounded transfer rates.
  - Make Markdown links terminal-clickable by materializing URLs.
  - `--metrics on|detailed` renders a single finish line with a compact transcript block (… words, …) before the model.
- **Cost**
  - Include OpenAI Whisper transcription estimate (duration-based) in the finish line total (`txcost=…`); configurable via `openai.whisperUsdPerMinute`.

### Docs

- Add `docs/language.md` and document language config + flag usage.

### Tests

- Add JSON-LD graph extraction coverage.
- Extend live podcast-host coverage (Podchaser, Spreaker, Buzzsprout).
- Raise global branch coverage threshold to 75% and add regression coverage for podcast/language/progress paths.

## 0.5.0 - 2025-12-24

### Features

- **Model selection & presets**
  - Automatic model selection (`--model auto`, now the default):
    - Chooses models based on input kind (website/YouTube/file/image/video/text) and prompt size.
    - Skips candidates without API keys; retries next model on request errors.
    - Adds OpenRouter fallback attempts when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is present.
    - Shows the chosen model in the progress UI.
  - Named model presets via config (`~/.summarize/config.json` → `models`), selectable as `--model <preset>`.
  - Built-in preset: `--model free` (OpenRouter `:free` candidates; override via `models.free`).
- **OpenRouter free preset maintenance**
  - `summarize refresh-free` regenerates `models.free` by scanning OpenRouter `:free` models and testing availability + latency.
  - `summarize refresh-free --set-default` also sets `"model": "free"` in `~/.summarize/config.json` (so free becomes your default).
- **CLI models**
  - Add `--cli <provider>` flag (equivalent to `--model cli/<provider>`).
  - `--cli` accepts case-insensitive providers and can be used without a provider to enable CLI auto selection.
- **Content extraction**
  - Website extraction detects video-only pages:
    - YouTube embeds switch to transcript extraction automatically.
    - Direct video URLs can be downloaded + summarized when `--video-mode auto|understand` and a Gemini key is available.
- **Env**
  - `.env` in the current directory is loaded automatically (so API keys work without exporting env vars).

### Changes

- **CLI config**
  - Auto mode uses CLI models only when `cli.enabled` is set; order follows the list.
  - `cli.enabled` is an allowlist for CLI usage.
- **OpenRouter**
  - Stop sending extra routing headers.
  - `--model free`: when OpenRouter rejects routing with “No allowed providers”, print the exact provider names to allow and suggest running `summarize refresh-free`.
  - `--max-output-tokens`: when explicitly set, it is also forwarded to OpenRouter calls.
- **Refresh Free**
  - Default extra runs reduced to 2 (total runs = 1 + runs) to reduce rate-limit pressure.
  - Filter `:free` candidates by recency (default: last 180 days; configurable via `--max-age-days`).
  - Print `ctx`/`out` in `k` units for readability.
- **Defaults**
  - Default summary length is now `xl`.

### Fixes

- **LLM / OpenRouter**
  - LLM request retries (`--retries`) and clearer timeout errors.
  - `summarize refresh-free`: detect OpenRouter free-model rate limits and back off + retry.
- **Streaming**
  - Normalize + de-dupe overlapping chunks to prevent repeated sections in live Markdown output.
- **YouTube**
  - Prefer manual captions over auto-generated when both exist. Thanks @dougvk.
  - Always summarize YouTube transcripts in auto mode (instead of printing the transcript).
- **Prompting & metrics**
  - Don’t “pad” beyond input length when asking for longer summaries.
  - `--metrics detailed`: fold metrics into finish line and make labels less cryptic.

### Docs

- Add documentation for presets and Refresh Free.
- Add a “make free the default” quick start for `summarize refresh-free --set-default`.
- Add a manual end-to-end checklist (`docs/manual-tests.md`).
- Add a quick CLI smoke checklist (`docs/smoketest.md`).
- Document CLI ordering and model selection behavior.

### Tests

- Add coverage for presets and Refresh Free regeneration.
- Add live coverage for the `free` preset.
- Add regression coverage for YouTube transcript handling and metrics formatting.

## 0.4.0 - 2025-12-21

### Changes

- Rename HTML→Markdown conversion flag to `--markdown-mode`.
- Add `--preprocess off|auto|always` and a `uvx markitdown` fallback for Markdown extraction and unsupported file attachments (when `--format md` is used).

## 0.3.0 - 2025-12-20

### Changes

- Add yt-dlp audio transcription fallback for YouTube; prefer OpenAI Whisper with FAL fallback. Thanks @dougvk.
- Add `--no-playlist` to yt-dlp downloads to avoid transcript mismatches.
- Run yt-dlp after web + Apify in `--youtube auto`, and error early for missing keys in `--youtube yt-dlp`.
- Require Node 22+.
- Respect `OPENAI_BASE_URL` when set, even with OpenRouter keys.
- Add OpenRouter configuration tests. Thanks @dougvk for the initial OpenRouter support.
- Build and ship a Bun bytecode arm64 binary for Homebrew.

### Dev

- Add `Dockerfile.test` for containerized yt-dlp testing.

## 0.2.0 - 2025-12-20

### Changes

- Add native OpenRouter support via `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
- Remove map-reduce summarization; reject inputs that exceed the model's context window.
- Preflight text prompts with the GPT tokenizer and the model’s max input tokens.
- Reject text files over 10 MB before tokenization.
- Reject too-small numeric `--length` and `--max-output-tokens` values.
- Cap summaries to the extracted content length when a requested size is larger.
- Skip summarization for tweets when extracted content is already below the requested length.
- Use bird CLI for tweet extraction when available and surface it in the status line.
- Fall back to Nitter for tweet extraction when bird fails; report a clear error when tweet data is unavailable.
- Compute cost totals via tokentally’s tally helpers.
- Improve fetch spinner with elapsed time and throughput updates.
- Show Firecrawl fallback status and reason when scraping kicks in.
- Enforce a hard deadline for stalled streaming LLM responses.
- Merge cumulative streaming chunks correctly and keep stream-merge for streaming output.
- Fall back to non-streaming when streaming requests time out.
- Preserve parentheses in URL paths when resolving inputs.
- Stop forcing Firecrawl for --extract-only; only use it as a fallback.
- Avoid Firecrawl fallback when block keywords only appear in scripts/styles.

### Tests

- Add CLI + live coverage for prompt length capping.
- Add coverage for cumulative stream merge handling.
- Add coverage for streaming timeout fallback.
- Add live coverage for Wikipedia URLs with parentheses.
- Add coverage for tweet summaries that bypass the LLM when short.

## 0.1.2 - 2025-12-20

### Fixes

- Release tooling: repair script quoting (no user-visible changes).

## 0.1.1 - 2025-12-19

### Fixes

- Accept common “pasted URL” patterns like `url (canonical)` and clean up accidental `\\?` / `\\=` / `%5C` before query separators.

## 0.1.0 - 2025-12-19

First public release.

### CLI

- `summarize` CLI shipped via `@steipete/summarize` (plus optional library exports).
- Inputs: URL, local file path, or remote file URL (PDFs/images/audio/video/text).
- Automatic map-reduce for large inputs.
- Streaming output by default on TTY, with Markdown → ANSI rendering (via `markdansi`).
- Final “Finished in …” line: timing, token usage, cost estimate (when pricing is available), and service counts.
- Flags:
  - `--model <provider/model>` (default `google/gemini-3-flash-preview`)
  - `--length short|medium|long|xl|xxl|<chars>` (guideline; no hard truncation)
  - `--max-output-tokens <count>` (optional hard cap)
  - `--timeout <duration>` (default `2m`)
  - `--stream auto|on|off`, `--render auto|md|plain`
  - `--extract` (URLs only; no summary)
  - `--json` (structured output incl. input config, prompt, extracted content, LLM metadata, and metrics)
  - `--metrics off|on|detailed` (default `on`)
  - `--verbose`

### Sources

- Websites: fetch + extract “article-ish” content + normalization for prompts.
- Firecrawl fallback for blocked/thin sites (`--firecrawl off|auto|always`, via `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`).
- Markdown extraction for websites in `--extract` mode (`--format md|text`, `--markdown-mode off|auto|llm`).
- YouTube (`--youtube auto|web|apify`):
  - best-effort transcript endpoints
  - optional Apify fallback (requires `APIFY_API_TOKEN`; single actor `faVsWy9VTSNVIhWpR`)
- Files (remote or local): MIME sniffing + best-effort forwarding to the model.
  - text-like inputs are inlined for provider compatibility

### LLM providers

- Direct-provider API keys (no gateway).
- OpenAI-compatible base URL support (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`).
- Model ids: `openai/...`, `anthropic/...`, `xai/...`, `google/...`.
- Auto-handling of provider/model limitations (e.g. no streaming support → non-streaming call; unsupported media types → friendly error).

### Pricing + limits

- Token/cost estimates and model limits derived from LiteLLM’s model catalog, downloaded + cached under `~/.summarize/cache/`.

### Quality

- CI: lint, tests (coverage), and pack.
- Tooling: Biome (lint/format) + Vitest (tests + coverage gate).
